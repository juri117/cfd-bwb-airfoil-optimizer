# airfoil optimization for BwB

This program implements an openMdao component, that optimizes an airfoil for minimum drag while making sure a defined rectangle is still fitting inside it. This rectangle represents the cabin tube of a blended wing body (BwB).

## Requirements:

- python:
  - the tested versions are 2.7 and 3.5
  - beside some standard packages openMdao is needed
    - http://openmdao.org/
- su2:
  - https://su2code.github.io/download.html
  - the version used here is: 6.0.0 "Falcon"
- construct2d(recommended):
  - https://sourceforge.net/projects/construct2d/
  - the version used here is: 2.1.4
- or gmsh:
  - http://gmsh.info/
  - the version used here is: 3.7.5

## Setup:

Set the paths to your binaries in **config.py**. Note, this program is designed for Windows!

## How to run it:

use your favourite python editor and open this repo as a new project.

- **main.py**: the main optimization program
- **cfdTestRun.py**: simple test script that runs one cfd job with a given input airfoil coordinate file
- **airofilAnalysisMach.py**: runs analysis on one airfoil, generates drag over mach for one liftcoefficient
- **airofilAnalysisPolar.py**: runs analysis on one airfoil, generates polar for one mach nr
- **cfdConvergenceTest.py**: does convergence analysis with different mesh sizes
